# Lens-Selection

#Usage for 2 Lens
Run the desired selection within the 2LensEFLFinder
Print the output of the list 'effective'
choose one of the outputs such as (np.float64(-90.9360446598327),
                                     np.float64(113.67005582479086),
                                     np.float64(34.224999999997166),
                                     np.float64(338.55725703435),
                                     np.float64(72.7822570343472),
                                     np.float64(0.006563747709002257),
                                     np.float64(899.5488048382368))
Insert into the Gaussian Trace Program to get a gaussian optics trace of the system

#3 Lens Finders
The 3 Lens EFL Finder takes considerably longer to attempt to find a solution
Carfeul, the 3LensEFL_Fast tries to remedy this with parallel processing but was is not fully tested yet
